Learning outcomes

In this app, I learned about combining action creators to abstract away perhaps many action creators behind just one, and how to use Lodash to ensure that requests are only made when the same request has not previously been made. This was accomplished by putting together a Lodash chain which maps over the returned list of blog posts (using the JsonPlaceholder API) and pulls off the userId property. This was then chained on to lodash's uniq function, which made sure there was only one instance of each userId. Then, that array was fed into a forEach loop which dispatched the request for a user only for each unique user.
